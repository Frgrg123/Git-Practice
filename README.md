## Software Engineering Article

This is an article I found about the disconnect between the skills that Universities focus on in Software Engineering programs, and the skills desired by start-ups. I found this article very interesting because as a senior graduating this winter, the job search is a very intimate subject for me. The article talks about skills that start-ups would find more useful than large companies, as well as how the role of engineers in start-ups can be different from the roles of engineers at big companies. As I have certainly applied to start-ups already, this article was very useful in granting a better understanding of the situations that engineers at start-ups can face.
